<h3>
	Draft Spec
</h3>
Designed around Array indices
Every element is a new line
Array's first element is the TAG
<br />
Both Attribute and Value can be omitted
<p class="primary">
	second element is the attribute object
</p>
<em>
	attributes are optional
</em>
<em>
	elements
	can have
	many children
</em>
<em>
	every child
	is a new line
</em>
values are optional
<b class="opt" />
<div class="wrapper">
	elements can
	be nested
	<span>
		arrays as values are children
	</span>
	<em class="fuga">
		nested
	</em>
	<p>
		children can have
		<b>
			children!
		</b>
	</p>
</div>
<hr />
Attributes with primitive values are rendered as they are written
<br foo="bar" x11="xorg" />
Attributes with
<em>
	Array
</em>
or
<em>
	Object
</em>
are treated differently
<br />
<h4>
	Attributes with Object as value
</h4>
<div class="wrapper" style="color=indigo; margin=12px;">
	default behaviour for any attribute with object as value
	is to fold the object with
	semicolon as delimiter
	and equal sign to delimit keys and values
</div>
<h4>
	Attributes with Array as value
</h4>
<a src="https://github.com/search?q=json&type=repositories&p=2&" />
Attributes with array values are querystrings
the first element is a prefix and the following object the query params
<span>
	bare val with no attr
</span>
<span>
	multi bare val with no attr
	moremore
</span>
<span id="bare" class="huh">
	bare value with attr
</span>
<span id="multi-bWattr">
	multi bare value with attr
	morewithtth
</span>
<span id="nested">
